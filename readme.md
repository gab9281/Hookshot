Hookshot is a static recompilation. The game's code is translated to C and compiled into a native Windows or Linux
program, the console's system software is reimplemented, and the Switch 2 graphics are rebuilt on Vulkan. All of this happens
**on your PC, from your own copy of the game**.

> saves) comes from your game and stays on your PC. Never share those files.

## Project status

Experimental. It has only been tested on **one Windows PC** (Ryzen 5 7600X, RTX 4060 Ti 16 GB) and **one Linux PC**,
mostly in the area at the start of the game.

| What | Status |
|---|---|
| Kokiri Forest: reaching gameplay and walking around | ✅ Works |
| Sound, controller, keyboard and saves | ✅ Works |
| In-game menu, frame generation and upscaling | ✅ Works |
| Linux, native (Wayland or X11): the title movie, play from a save, sound, a DualSense, the menu | ✅ Works |
| Rebinding the controller and the keyboard (in the menu) | ✅ Works |
| Black flashes while moving | ✅ Fixed in testing, more play needed |
| Performance without frame generation | ⚠️ About 50 fps walking, not yet a steady 60 |
| Models with missing pieces (doors, fences, parts of trees) | ✅ Fixed where tested, more play needed |
| Stutter when entering new areas | ⚠️ Still happens, mostly the first time |
| Ultrawide | ⚠️ The 3D keeps its shape, but the HUD is stretched and the picture is softer |
| Hyrule Field and the rest of the game | ❓ Not tested yet |
| AMD and Intel cards | ❓ Never tested |

## How to build

The game does not come ready-made: it is built on your PC from your copy.

**With Hookshot Builder, the easiest:**

1. Download the HookshotBuilder zip from the Releases page, extract it, and run `HookshotBuilder.exe`. Keep the `tools`
   folder beside it.
2. Choose your game's `.nup`, or your `romfs` and `exefs` folders. The builder checks that it is the right version.
3. Choose a language and a folder for the finished game, and start the build.
4. When it finishes, open `hookshot.exe` in that folder.

**From the command line:**

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --nup "C:\path\your-game.nup" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Or with folders:

```powershell
python -I nx2/make_game.py --romfs "C:\path\romfs" --exefs "C:\path\exefs" --out "C:\Games\Hookshot" --language en-US
```

Add `--check` with your `.nup` or `--exefs` to only check the game's version. It builds nothing.

A build takes about 40 minutes, and you can use your PC in the meantime.

**On Linux, with the release folder:**

1. Download `Hookshot-linux.tar.gz` from the Releases page and extract it (`tar -xzf`, which keeps the files
   executable). Keep everything in the folder together.
2. Run `./hookshot`, or `./hookshot /path/to/your-game.nup`. The first time, it builds the game from your `.nup` into
   that folder, then prepares the shaders (a minute or two; you can skip it, and the game then prepares each shader
   the first time it draws it, with short stutters). It shows its progress in a window, or in the terminal when there is
   no desktop. Everything it prints is also in `build.log`.
3. After that, `./hookshot` starts the game. It builds again only when the folder is updated.

The folder brings everything it needs: its own Python, compiler and helpers, SDL3 and FFmpeg. Nothing needs to be
installed.

**On Linux, from the command line:**

```sh
scripts/fetch-deps.sh linux        # the pinned dependencies, into work/deps
python3 -I nx2/make_game.py --target linux --nup ~/your-game.nup --out ~/Games/Hookshot --language en-US
```

This needs clang, lld, pkg-config, SDL3's and FreeType's development files and the Python packages below. Then start
`hookshot_rt` in the output folder.

The Windows game can also be built on Linux (and played with Proton or Wine). Microsoft's C library and Windows SDK
are downloaded once by [xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin), which asks you to accept Microsoft's licence:

```sh
cargo install xwin --locked
scripts/setup-winsysroot.sh
python3 -I nx2/make_game.py --target windows --nup ~/your-game.nup --out ~/Games/Hookshot --language en-US
```

This needs clang and lld (with `lld-link`).

### What you need

- On Windows: 64-bit Windows 10 or 11, and the Visual Studio C++ tools and the Windows SDK. Microsoft does not allow
  these to be bundled, so install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with
  "Desktop development with C++". The builder tells you if they are missing.
- On Linux: 64-bit, with glibc 2.35 or newer (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12 or later), Wayland or X11, and the Vulkan
  driver for your card. The release folder needs nothing else.
- A graphics card with Vulkan 1.3 and mesh shaders, with an up-to-date driver. Only NVIDIA has been tested.
- 16 GB of RAM or more. A run uses about 10 GB.
- About 60 GB free while building.
- **Your copy of the game at the supported version:** program `0400486024DEC000`, update v131072, build `e0f3ccfa`.
  Other versions do not work.

To build from the command line you also need:

- Python 3 with `lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `zstandard` and `unicorn`.
- The clang from [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk), at `C:\emsdk`.
- Visual Studio 2022 with .NET 8, only if you want to change the builder itself.
- The prebuilt tools that go in `third_party/`: `a64emit`, `lld-link`, `zbic` and SDL3.

### What this does on your PC

- The build reads your game and never changes it. It writes to the folder you choose and to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder` (Linux: `~/.local/share/HookshotBuilder`).
- The romfs is hard-linked instead of copied where the disk allows it.
- Your saves are kept where your system keeps games' saves: `Documents\My Games\Hookshot` on Windows (where
  Documents is, OneDrive included), `~/.local/share/hookshot` on Linux (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot`). A new or rebuilt
  game folder finds them there. Saves from an older version, in a `user` folder beside the game, are moved there the
  first time, and `saves-moved.txt` beside the game says where. `--user <folder>` uses another folder.
- On Linux, the launcher adds Hookshot to your desktop's menus with its icon
  (`~/.local/share/applications/io.github.gab9281.Hookshot.desktop`), and updates it if you move the folder. Set
  `HOOKSHOT_NO_DESKTOP=1` to leave it out.
- It compiles with half your processor's threads. With little memory, use fewer: set `HOOKSHOT_JOBS`, for example
  `HOOKSHOT_JOBS=3 ./hookshot`.
- To uninstall, delete the game folder and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HookshotBuilder` (Linux: `~/.local/share/HookshotBuilder`
  and the desktop file above). Your saves stay until you delete their folder too.

### If something goes wrong

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| "Hookshot supports build e0f3ccfa" | Check that you chose the right game with its update installed |
| The game opens and closes | Update your graphics driver |
| Stutter the first time you see something | Normal for now: shaders are being prepared. It gets better when you pass through the same place again |
| The game is in the wrong language | Change the code in `language.txt` beside the game. The file lists them all |

If the problem continues, report it with where you were in the game, your graphics card and a screenshot or video.
Never send game files.

## In-game menu

Press <kbd>Insert</kbd> or <kbd>F1</kbd> in game. On a controller, press its Home button (PS on a DualSense), or Select
and Start together. Everything is off by default, and your choices are saved in `hookshot_options.ini` beside the game.

The arrow keys or the D-pad choose and change. <kbd>Enter</kbd> or the bottom face button selects, and <kbd>Esc</kbd>
or the right face button goes back.

| Option | Choices |
|---|---|
| Fullscreen | Off, On (also <kbd>F11</kbd>) |
| Frame generation | Off, 2x, 3x, 4x |
| Frame pacing | Off, On |
| Resolution | Auto (the game's own dynamic resolution), 100%, 75%, 67%, 50% |
| Upscaling | Off, Catmull-Rom, Lanczos |
| Sharpness | 0 to 100% |
| Game speed | Per frame, Real time |
| Handheld profile | Off, On |
| Ultrawide | 16:9, Monitor's shape |
| FPS counter | Off, On |
| Controls | Opens the Controls page |

With Game speed on Per frame, the game runs slower whenever it is below 60 fps. Real time keeps it at normal speed.

### Controls

Use a controller, or the keyboard and mouse. On the keyboard, <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> move
and the arrow keys turn the camera. Click in the window to turn the camera with the mouse; <kbd>Esc</kbd> lets it go.

The menu's **Controls** page lists each of the Switch's buttons with what presses it on a controller and on the
keyboard. Select one and press the new button or key. <kbd>Delete</kbd> clears it, and "Reset to defaults" puts every
one back. A controller button taken from another one swaps with it, and a key is taken from any other button. The
mouse buttons and the movement and camera keys cannot be changed.

To change which gamepad button or key presses a Switch button, open the in-game menu's Controls page. Choose a
button and a column, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or the bottom face button), then the new button or key; <kbd>Delete</kbd>
clears it, and Reset to defaults puts them all back. A gamepad button taken from another Switch button swaps with it.
The page saves them in `hookshot_options.ini`, where you can also write them yourself:

```ini
pad_a=0
key_a=69,13
```

`pad_<button>` is a gamepad input by position: 0 bottom face button, 1 right, 2 left, 3 top, 4 Select or Back, 5 Home,
6 Start, 7 and 8 the stick presses, 9 and 10 the shoulder buttons, 11 to 14 the D-pad (up, down, left, right), 15 and
16 the triggers, -1 none. `key_<button>` is one or two
[Windows key codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes) in decimal (69 is
<kbd>E</kbd>, 13 <kbd>Enter</kbd>), 0 none. The buttons are `a` `b` `x` `y` `l` `r` `zl` `zr` `plus` `minus` `ls`
`rs` `left` `up` `right` `down`. A button the file leaves out keeps its default.

## Mods

Put mods in a `mods` folder beside `hookshot.exe` (or point `HOS_MODS` at another folder), in the layout emulators
use: `mods/<name>/romfs/...` holds files that replace or add to the game's own. Deeper layouts such as
`mods/contents/<title id>/<name>/romfs` work too. A folder whose name starts with `-` or `_` is off. When two mods
have the same file, the one whose folder name sorts last wins, so name them `01-...`, `02-...` to set the order.

Only RomFS mods are loaded. `exefs` patches (`.pchtxt`, `.ips`) are left out: Hookshot compiles the game's code ahead
of time, so patching its instructions would need a rebuild. The log (`hookshot_log.txt` when started from its icon)
names each mod and the files read from it.

## How it works

1. `nx2/lift.py` translates the game's ARM64 code to C.
2. `nx2/build.py` compiles that C together with `host/`, which plays the part of the console's system.
3. `host/nvn_native.c` records the game's NVN2 graphics calls, and `gpu/vk/` replays them on Vulkan.
4. Switch 2 Ampere shaders are lowered to Maxwell (`lower_to_maxwell.h`) and translated to SPIR-V by Eden's shader
   recompiler.

More detail is in the [development guide](docs/development.md) and the [design notes](docs/design.md).

## Want to help?

Testing on other graphics cards and reporting the result already helps a lot, and so does playing further into the
game than anyone has yet.

Bigger ways to help:

- **Linux on other PCs.** The native Linux build has been played on one PC so far. Reports from other distributions,
  desktops and graphics cards help.
- **Fixes in your own fork.** Fork the project, fix what you find and send the change back. Keep game files, keys and
  anything generated from your game out of it.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the setup, the test commands, the code conventions and what a good pull request
looks like.
